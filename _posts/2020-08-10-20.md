### **Wakaresaseya**


[Wakaresaseya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakaresaseya) or "breaker-uppers" is the name given to Japanese businesses that specialize in breaking up relationships. This is often achieved by drawing one of the partners into an affair or by producing other incriminating evidence. A customer names a target, and an undercover employee of the company then initiates an affair with the target and/or produces other incriminating evidence, and though most often used to gather evidence of infidelity for use in a divorce case, they are also used for purposes ranging from bringing shame to someone, getting an employee to resign, luring away the lover of one's spouse, or breaking up some other relationship.

### **Boring Billion**

[Boring Billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boring_Billion) or Dullest Time in Earth's History is the name given to the time period between 1.8 and 0.8 billion years ago, characterized by tectonic stability, climatic stasis, and stalled biological evolution. Although bordered by two oxygenation and glacial events, but the Boring Billion itself had very low oxygen levels and no evidence of glaciation. It is theorized that oceans may have been oxygen and nutrient poor and would have appeared black and milky-turquoise instead of blue due to the presence of photosynthetic bacteria that released sulfur instead of oxygen.
