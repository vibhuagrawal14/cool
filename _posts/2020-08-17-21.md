### **Rashomon effect**

### **Ten Cent Beer Night**

In 1974, the Cleveland Indians ran a promotion to boost attendance during a game against the Texas Rangers at the Cleveland Stadium. The idea was to attract people by offering 10 cent beers (as opposed to the standard 65 cents), with a limit of 6 beers per purchase, but no limit on the number of purchases. The idea didn't exactly go according to plan, and soon the fans became heavily intoxicated and ending up rioting in the ninth inning causing the game to be forfeited.
