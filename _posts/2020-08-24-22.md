### **Benford's Law**

Benford's Law, or the law of anomalous mumber, is an intersting phenomenon to say the least. The law states that the leading significant digit in many real-life numerical data is likely to be small. If the data is uniformly distributed (which is exceptionally rare in real life), each digit would have a 11.11% chance of being the first digit in any randomly picked number. In contrast, Benford's law states that the probabilities linked to each digit being the leading significant digit is as follows:

```
╔═══╦═══════╗
║ d ║  P(d) ║
╠═══╬═══════╣
║ 1 ║ 30.1% ║
╠═══╬═══════╣
║ 2 ║ 17.6% ║
╠═══╬═══════╣
║ 3 ║ 12.5% ║
╠═══╬═══════╣
║ 4 ║  9.7% ║
╠═══╬═══════╣
║ 5 ║  7.9% ║
╠═══╬═══════╣

╠═══╬═══════╣

╠═══╬═══════╣
║ 8 ║  5.1% ║
╠═══╬═══════╣
║ 9 ║  4.6% ║
╚═══╩═══════╝
```

The law has been shown to hold true for a variety of data like electricity bills, house numbers, populations, stock prices, and death rates. It tends to be most accurate when values are distributed across multiple orders of magnitude, especially if the process generating the numbers is described by a power law (which are common in nature).

Interstingly enough, it even holds true across different units of measurement.

### **Complaint tablet to Ea-nasirt**

The complaint tablet to Ea-nasir is a clay tablet from ancient Babylon written c. 1750 BC. It is a complaint to a merchant named Ea-nasir from a customer named Nanni. Written in cuneiform, it is considered to be the oldest known written complaint. 

The context and translation from wikipedia:

Ea-nasir travelled to the Persian Gulf to buy copper and return to sell it in Mesopotamia. On one particular occasion, he had agreed to sell copper ingots to Nanni. Nanni sent his servant with the money to complete the transaction. The copper was sub-standard and not accepted. In response, Nanni created the cuneiform letter for delivery to Ea-nasir. Inscribed on it is a complaint to Ea-nasir about a copper delivery of the incorrect grade, and issues with another delivery. He also complained that his servant (who handled the transaction) had been treated rudely. He stated that, at the time of writing, he had not accepted the copper but had paid the money.

Translation:
```
Tell Ea-nа̄ṣir: Nanni sends the following message:

When you came, you said to me as follows : "I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots." You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Ṣīt-Sin) and said "If you want to take them, take them, if you do not want to take them, go away!"

What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money (deposited with you) but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed several times, and that through enemy territory. Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way? You alone treat my messenger with contempt! On account of that one (trifling) mina of silver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have given to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of copper, and Šumi-abum has likewise given 1,080 pounds of copper, apart from what we both have had written on a sealed tablet to be kept in the temple of Šamaš.

How have you treated me for that copper? You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory; it is now up to you to restore (my money) to me in full.

Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.
