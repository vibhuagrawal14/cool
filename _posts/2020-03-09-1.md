### **Year Without a Summer**


A massive eruption of Mount Tambora in April 1815 caused the world to plunge into a volcanic winter resulting in what is now known as the [Year Without a Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer). Average global temperatures dropped by 0.4 - 0.7Â°C resulting in crop failure, famine, and epidemics. 

Apart from significant socio-political effects, the anomalous event is accredited for a number of now celebrated works of music, literature, and art such as Shelley's _Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus_, Byron's _Darkness_, and J M W Turner's _Chichester Canal_.

### **The Leftovers**

As the number of people affected by the novel coronavirus consistently rose last week, one particular figure was thrown about a lot: 2%. This was the initial estimate of the virus' mortality rate (the latest estimate is at 3.4%). People comforted each other, and themselves, with this seemingly tiny figure and found solace in the supposed fact that 2% of the population isn't a significant number. 

[The Leftovers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2699128/) is an acclaimed TV series, rated highly by viewers and critics alike, which follows the lives and struggles of a small New York community three years after 2% of the world's population disappears. The exceptional writing, acting, tone, and score make for a phenomenal experience.

### **The Evolution of Trust**

This brilliant [game by Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/trust/) explains the Prisoner's Dilemma better than most resources out there, and in the process explores the mechanisms of trust from a game theory perspective.

>That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're "merely" products of our environment -- but as game theory reminds us, we are each others' environment. In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run, it's us players who define the game.
