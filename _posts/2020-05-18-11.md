### **Zone of Death**

The Zone of Death is a 50 sq mile area of the Yellowstone National Park in Idaho wherea criminal can get away with any crime, even murder. This is due to a loophole in the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution which exploits the fact that juries in federal criminal cases must be made up of citizens who are from both the district and state where the crime was committed, but that this 50 sq mile area in Idaho is completely uninhabited and no such jury could be assembled.

### **The 27th stanza of the Shishupala Vadha**

The 27th stanza of the epic Sanskrit poem Shishupala Vadha written in 7th or 8th century is an example of what has been called "the most complex and exquisite type of palindrome ever invented". Sanskrit aestheticians call it sarvatobhadra, "perfect in every direction" — it yields the same text if read forwards, backwards, down, or up:

<center>सकारनानारकास-  <br>
कायसाददसायका ।  <br>
रसाहवा वाहसार-  <br>
नादवाददवादना ॥  </center>
<br>
```
sa	kā	ra	nā	nā	ra	kā	sa 
kā	ya	sā	da	da	sā	ya	kā 
ra	sā	ha	vā	vā	ha	sā	ra 
nā	da	vā	da	da	vā	da	nā
  

(and the lines reversed)  
nā	da	vā	da	da	vā	da	nā 
ra	sā	ha	vā	vā	ha	sā	ra 
kā	ya	sā	da	da	sā	ya	kā 
sa	kā	ra	nā	nā	ra	kā	sa 
```
This translates to: [That army], which relished battle (rasāhavā) contained allies who brought low the bodes and gaits of their various striving enemies (sakāranānārakāsakāyasādadasāyakā), and in it the cries of the best of mounts contended with musical instruments (vāhasāranādavādadavādanā).
