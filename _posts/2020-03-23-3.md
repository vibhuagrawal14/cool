### **Narcissism of small differences**


Freud proposed in 1917, based on earlier work by Ernest Crawley, that communities which had adjoining territories and were closely related to each in other ways as well constantly ridiculed each other and engaged in feuds. It is this hypersensitivity to details of differentiation that he termed the [narcissism of small differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences).

### **The Mariko Aoki Phenomenon**

The readers' letters column of the February 1985 issue of _Book Magazine_ printed an amusing letter by a woman called Mariko Aoki. She had written that "I'm not sure why, but since about two or three years ago, whenever I go to a bookstore I am struck by an urge to move my bowels." While the letter itself was short, the immediate response upon the issue's publication was overwhelming, with readers from across Japan writing to the magazine about having been troubled by the same phenomenon. Since then, the phenomenon has been discussed in popular media every now and then, and the sudden urge to defecate after entering a bookstore has come to be called the [Mariko Aoki phenomenon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariko_Aoki_phenomenon).

### **1904 Olympic Marathon in St. Louis**

Copied verbatim from a [comment by u/Zuke020](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/f9cufu/what_are_some_ridiculous_history_facts/fird56c/):


The #1 finisher drove most of the race. He started the race, got tired and heat exhausted and wanted to drop out. He got in a car to DQ himself and head back to the stadium but along the way realized he was near the finish line and got out to claim the glory.  

The #2 finisher was carried across the finish line by his trainers. On a bogus pseudoscience theory, the trainers had been giving him a mixture of brandy, egg whites, and rat poison instead of water. When it came out that the #1 finisher had driven most of the course, this guy was given the gold despite the help from his trainers to finish.  
  
For some reason, the #3 finisher was just a regular guy who did nothing unusual. In this case, ordinary was extraordinary.  
  
The #4 finisher was a Cuban Mailman, who had raised the money to attend the Olympics by running around his entire country and asking for donations. When he landed in New Orleans, he lost all the money gambling. He managed to scrounge enough to get to St. Louis and attend the Olympics. However, he had no money for athletic gear, so he ran in dress shoes and pants hacked off at the knee by a fellow racer who happened to have a knife. He probably would have come in first had it not been for the hour-long nap he took on the side of the road after eating rotten apples he found at an orchard near the course.  
  
The #9 and #12 finishers were from South Africa, and ran barefoot. South Africa didn't actually send a delegation - these were students who just happened to be in town and thought it sounded fun. #9 was chased a mile off course by angry dogs.  

Half the participants had never raced competitively before. Some died. St. Louis only had one water stop on the entire run. This, coupled with the dusty road, and exacerbated by the cars kicking up dust, lead to several fatalities.  
  
The Russian delegation arrived a week late because they were still using the Julian calendar until 1918, while effectively the rest of the world had switched to the Gregorian calendar.
