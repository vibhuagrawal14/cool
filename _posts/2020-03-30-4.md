### **Clarke's three laws**

[Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke) formulated three laws, which he used in his extensive writings about the future:  

1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

### **Unauthorized Bread**

Cory Doctorow's epic novella, [Unauthorized Bread](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/), is a cautionary tale about about technological advancement, class divide, and the unchecked use of DRMs. Set in the near future, it tells the story of dehumanized refugees and how they are exploited by high-tech versions of mundane products like toasters, thermostats, and even elevators. Speedy and memorable, the story undoubtedly carries a strong message about ethics, empathy, and the ever relevant battle against DRMs.

### **Mortality rate goes down during an economic depression**

>There are many potential contributors. One of the more predictable perks of a poor economy is fewer job-related accidents. The most-experienced workers are the ones most likely to keep their jobs during a recession, and slower production can allow for more attention to safety.

>People also tend to drive less, which translates to fewer traffic accidents6. And fewer vehicles on the road might also help to explain why air quality is better.

>...smoking and excess weight declined during economic downturns, whereas leisure-time physical activity increased.

### **Social-Engineering Attack on the FBI**

In 1971, burglars [broke into an FBI office](https://boingboing.net/2014/02/05/social-engineering-the-fbi-in.html) by writing a note that said “Please don’t lock this door tonight” and plastering it onto the front door. 
>Sure enough, when the burglars arrived that night, someone had obediently left the door unlocked. The burglars entered the office with ease, stole the Selective Service records, and left. They were so pleased with themselves that one of them proposed leaving a thank-you note on the door.
