### **King James Programming**

Michael Walker's [project](https://kingjamesprogramming.tumblr.com/page/8) from 2013-2016 generated posts using a Markov chain trained on King James Bible, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, and some of Eric S. Raymond's writings. Here are some of those posts:

**The First Book of Moses: Called Genesis**  
**1:1** In the beginning of the process was stored in a single system, however, we will generate sequences of instructions that use the machineâ€™s data paths for a general-purpose computer.

**8:29** And king Joram went back to the compiler.

**26:58** These are the two binary numbers to be added

**16:19** Also now, behold, my witness is not true. In the query system, we used a succession of programs, most of which involve designing new data structures called streams.

**46:2** Therefore will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will see how to model change in terms of mathematical functions.

### **Postal service in the Akkadian Empire**

The Akkadian Empire of Mesopotamia, which flourished in the 3rd millenium BC, is considered to have developed the oldest postal system in history. The system was supported by the network of roads that bound the empire together. The posts consisted of clay tablets inscribed in the cuneiform Akkadian script, which were wrapped in clay envelopes. These "envelopes" had the name and address of the recipient, and the seal of the sender inscribed on them. The method was surprisingly tamper-proof, as the only way to open such an envelop was to break it.

### **Schmidt sting pain index**

The [Schmidt sting pain index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_sting_pain_index) is an index of how painful the stings of various hymenoptera are. It was developed by Justin O. Schmidt who claims to have been stung by a majority of stinging Hymenoptera. The scale has 4 levels - 1,2,3, and 4 - in increasing order of pain. Schmidt's descriptions of various stings are interesting to say the least, a few of which are listed here:

* (talking about the sting of a digger bee, classified Pain Level 1) ...almost pleasant, a lover just bit your earlobe a little too hard.
* (talking about the sting of a yellowjacket, classified Pain Level 2) ...hot and smoky, almost irreverent. Imagine W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue.
* (talking about the sting of a Maricopa harvester ant, classified Pain Level 3) After eight unrelenting hours of drilling into that ingrown toenail, you find the drill wedged into the toe.
* (talking about the sting of a warrior wasp, one of the only 3 stings classified Pain Level 4) Torture. You are chained in the flow of an active volcano. Why did I start this list?
